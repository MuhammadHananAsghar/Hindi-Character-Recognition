# Hindi Character Recognition Using Keras

## Keras
```Keras``` is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. Up until version 2.3, Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, and PlaidML.

## Objectives
In this Project we create and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , using ```Keras``` library. The objective of this project is to recognize hindi characters of 46 different classes.
